What tools are you going to use for monitoring and alerting purposes, and how they are going to be integrated with the infrastructure?
There are many tools for this specific need like splunk, datadog, dynatrace, solarwinds, Kibana and many more. Even AWS provide managed tool for this link Cloudwtach logs, Container Insight and Cloudtaril.
However, I prefer to use open source tool for montoring and alerting.

I will use Prometheus with Grafana for monitoring and alerting purpose.

1. Prometheus will be used to scrape CloudWatch metrics from our ECS Fargate cluster using CloudWatch Exporter. Cloudwatch Exporter is a tool that collects CloudWatch metrics and exposes 
   them in a format that Prometheus can scrape.
   Some of the important metrics for ECS:
      CPU and memory usage
      Task and container counts
      Cluster and service health
      I/O metrics: I/O metrics such as disk read and write operations
      Network metrics
2. Grafana for Visualization
  > I will install Grafana and configure it to use Prometheus as a data source.
  > Will create dashboards and visualizations based on the CloudWatch metrics available in Prometheus.
3. Prometheus Alerting:
   Prometheus has a built-in alerting mechanism that involves two main components:
 3.1 Alerting Rules: We define alerting rules in Prometheus, which are evaluated at regular intervals. These rules specify conditions under which alerts should be triggered, 
         based on the metrics that Prometheus collects.
	       Alerting rules are typically defined in a YAML file (e.g., prometheus.yml)
 3.2 Prometheus uses Alertmanager to manage the alerts generated by the alerting rules.
    	Alertmanager is responsible for handling, grouping, silencing, and routing alerts to different 	destinations like email, Slack, PagerDuty, or custom webhooks.
	    We can configure Alertmanager to send alerts to specific channels based on labels or other conditions.
